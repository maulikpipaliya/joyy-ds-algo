1. Make program testable


10^8 ops = 1 second -> 

n = 10^7 = O(n)
n = 10^6 = O(n * log n )
n = 10^4 = O(n^2)


Correctness
 - Check overflows, "final" declaration for required data types
 - avoid Object creation 
 - Scanner slows down, use InputReader
 - avoid too many static functions 

Efficiency
 - use library functions as much as possible
 - write freaking jUnit @Test-ing
 - assertEquals("RESULT", functionToCall())

Debuggability 
 - avoid too many global variables 
 - Separate logic from Pre-processing
 - variable/function pneumonics must make sense
